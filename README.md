## Style Guide

### Top-level headings are h3

All top level headings must be `h3` tags. `h1` is reserved by Canvas, and `h2` is typically too large for most cases. Stick with `h3` tags for page titles.

### Sub-headings are h5 and h6

All sub headings must transition from an `h3` to a `h5` next and then a `h6` if needed. Do not break out of that order. This setup follows like an article/book layout. The theme was designed to work best this way.
